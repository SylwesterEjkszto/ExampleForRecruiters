# ExampleForRecruiters

Sample recruitment task in which I used pure python. 


In the assignment task.txt file, you can find a description of the assignment and the assumptions I followed, or read the following:

The `texts.csv` file contains a list of files to analyze.
The text files are located in the `data` folder.

For each record in the `texts.csv` file, you need to:
1. recalculate the number of paragraphs.
2. the total number of sentences in the file and the average number of sentences in the paragraphs.
3. the total number of characters in the file and the average number of characters in the paragraphs.
4. the number of punctuation marks in the entire file.
5. the average number of words in a paragraph.

Save the results in a new `results.csv` file that has the basic information from the original file and the results of the calculations.


Assumptions:
- each sentence is separated by a period
- we use Python 3
- external libraries cannot be used for the solution (only built-in libraries)
- You can not modify the supplied `texts.csv` file and text files
